[00:09:27] [@Reuben_eth]: hey Pamela
[00:09:53] [@john0isaac]: nope, testing it with you
[00:10:26] [@libis22]: just heard about it 5 mins before.. :D
[00:10:47] [@john0isaac]: there are commands folder
[00:11:06] [@john0isaac]: scripts*
[00:22:41] [@john0isaac]: can you try /speckit.clarify?
[00:24:13] [@john0isaac]: it only goes one way
[00:27:15] [@john0isaac]: it says duration 3 days, is it going to take 3 days for every task? 
[00:27:56] [@john0isaac]: After i ran /tasks

[00:40:09] [@john0isaac]: you are not in correct repo
[00:42:31] [@john0isaac]: I followed the demo's example without changing the project or anything and I got an error
[00:42:31] [@john0isaac]: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/node_modules/sql.js/dist/sql-wasm.js?v=2a13320c' does not provide an export named 'default' (at database.js:5:8)
[00:46:19] [@john0isaac]: right?
[00:47:53] [@AkhileswarChinnaguravagari-r5g]: I think it is really great to start a new project with this but will this approach work for a project which we already started?
