sometimes it feels like I'm stuck between "yeah, i know it". I watch bunch of tutorials of the thing getting done. But when i actually try doing it I'm completely lost.
How to tackle this?

What if we are having a sub agents and when user changes their questions between conversation how to maintain distinction?
Syed Alam Shah

 — 11:41 AM
Pamela is it possible for someone from pakistan getting into microsoft as a intern then full time?
Techimatata — 11:41 AM
In copilot agents it is messing up previous questions
when we have an agent to create tickets and in the middle of generation of tickets how to maintain the context and maintain distinction between different topics they are talking about instead of cutting the older topics
pablocotan — 11:44 AM
in copilot studio you can use the so called "topics" where you can make use of those tips to guide the direction of the conversation or the path the agent takes to answer

pablocotan — 11:46 AM
you can also define your own entities in the settings, and this can also be used in the topics.
All of this is managed in settings, graphically, or in workflows.

When you're using sub agents it will depend on your how your using orchestration. It may help to add churn detection and escalation steps into your topics if you don't get the appropriate response a certain number of times.

Is there a way to search for AI hackathons?
Techimatata — 11:56 AM
Thanks for all the tips
pablocotan — 11:56 AM
During the last weeks, there has been a lot of activity in youtube  and X with people using Claude-Code and Antigravity for complex tasks. Also OpenCode is in this group.

They are very interesting due to the architecture they have.
I know that they are not for any task that we may want to accomplish, but the problem is that the idea behind them of creating a plan, dividing the task in many steps, implementing them separately and testing each of them before continuing, and storing the progress in files, it seems the most logical path to be successful for complex tasks at the moment.

I wonder what iy your impresision about this. Because if we need to create such an architecture for every project, it would probably take a lot of effort and complexity compared with simple multi-agents architectures that we see around in demos using Microsoft Agent Framework, Google ADK, LangChain/LangGraph, etc.

What do you think about this?

Pamela is right about unpaid—big important part is explaining the logic behind project choices and frameworks. It also protects you from bad jobs where HR doesn’t understand nuanced details

I think this process came from SDD ( spec driven development)
one final question, I saw Den Delimarsky left the org. do we have someone to actively maitain spec kit or is it left for the community ? we have some ideas in using spec kit into our solution.
