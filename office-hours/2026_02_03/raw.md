IMO stay away for now, but it is a neat social experiment, art, not sure what to call it, lol. The moltbook supabase backend is not secure.

I saw a video from Moltbook all the secrets are aviable through their API. Its completely open
Humans are also posting on Moltbook sooo.. lol
BlackPandaChan — 11:08 AM
Yeah justin it's wild, I just had to call it out because people quickly go from installing clawdbot or nanoclawd to using moltbook

sounds fine here @yass 🦆
BlackPandaChan — 11:09 AM
Moltbook DID make me think about building something similar within a discord community, as a fun social experiement, or a local reddit like lemming (where friends' agents can post) could be fun (and more secure)

it should be free right now, and 2x if you pay
It is but this is brand new as of yesterday*
BlackPandaChan — 11:18 AM
Everytime I've tried to use codex (pre 5.2 to be fair) I've regretted  not just doing it in claude code, lol. I've had decent luck with features, though.
Justin Trantham [FlowDevs.io]

 — 11:18 AM
yes
BlackPandaChan — 11:18 AM
The codex "app" is new!
gcrumrine — 11:19 AM
I think I still prefer the CLI.
Justin Trantham [FlowDevs.io]

 — 11:20 AM
The automations & prompt queueing seem interesting. I've seen other platforms include the prompt queueing recently (seems like it could also be a credit waster)

Can you briefly explain what skills are? They are a bit confusing to me
Steve Hatt — 11:22 AM
How do I control the availability of skills i.e. can I block the use of ones my team found problematic?

👍
Justin Trantham [FlowDevs.io]

 — 11:25 AM
this. is. amazing.
gcrumrine — 11:26 AM
I think the biggest downside of the skills/task specific instructions workflow is that there seems to be context loss pretty frequently when you are chaining them together.
Right? So when a skill is invoked it should have all the information, but in my experience when you have a skill that can also invoke another skill sometimes it feels like a new session is somehow opened.
HeyMsShipley

 — 11:30 AM
do we have to use insiders to do this?
gcrumrine — 11:30 AM
This one looks pretty cool though
good idea.

Dang, I wish everyone had that mentality. Code review is always a mental block for me because theres always a "better" way of doing things from someone else's point of view.

MCP on codex is a pain...
It does, but you have to enable it
gcrumrine — 11:46 AM
in the cli I always have to run using the "--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox" flag to get it to work properly with the MCP's I am wanting to use.
Justin Trantham [FlowDevs.io]

 — 11:47 AM
Dont quote me on that for the app - thats a CLI setting
gcrumrine — 11:50 AM
Lol create the agent to control the multiple agents. Offload mental load.
Good info there.
Sure, just a joke really.

i saw your linkedin agent project using playwright, i have a question is it safe to ask agent to do job search in linkedin without getting blocked by linkedin as i assume they stopped offering jobs api for public.
