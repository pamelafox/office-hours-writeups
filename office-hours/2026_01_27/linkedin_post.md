🐍 This week's Python + AI Office Hours covered a lot of ground!

Topics we covered:

🖼️ MCP Apps: The new official MCP extension that lets servers pass down rich UIs instead of just text. Could this be the future of how we interact with the web?

⚙️ VS Code Insiders updates: Agent HQ, 200K context, isolated terminal sandbox, and more

🤖 GitHub Copilot SDK & CLI: Programmatic access to Copilot without deploying models

🔐 RAG demo ACL support: New release adds document-level security filtering with Azure Data Lake Storage

📋 SpecKit: Spec-driven development for coding agents (tried it out in a follow-up livestream!)

🧠 Foundry IQ vs MCP: When to use knowledge bases vs MCP tools

📅 Upcoming events:
• AI Dev Days Hackathon
• Agent League (esports-style coding battles!)
• Python + Agents series starting soon
