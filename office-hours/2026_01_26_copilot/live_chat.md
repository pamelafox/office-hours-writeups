[00:00:00] [@CarlosPCmx]: HI thanks!!
[00:00:48] [@john0isaac]: Hii
[00:02:13] [@arielrivera]: Hola from Texas!
[00:02:40] [@john0isaac]: you can use pip or uv
[00:03:15] [@john0isaac]: ohh you are installing cli not sdk
[00:13:15] [@PamelaFox]: https://x.com/_Evan_Boyle
[00:18:05] [@PamelaFox]: https://github.com/github/copilot-cli...
[00:19:22] [@PamelaFox]: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/ho...
[00:24:13] [@john0isaac]: try options
[00:27:29] [@john0isaac]: I think the cli has it's own tools
[00:27:34] [@john0isaac]: not the same as vscode tools
[00:29:49] [@PamelaFox]: https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk
[00:31:00] [@john0isaac]: The pr visualization example is cool
[00:32:39] [@john0isaac]: I fixed them 
[00:32:49] [@john0isaac]: sent it to you on teams
[00:33:06] [@john0isaac]: nope lol
[00:34:01] [@john0isaac]: I think it's a different version of the cli
[00:34:09] [@john0isaac]: sdk*
[00:34:27] [@john0isaac]: yes
[00:34:43] [@john0isaac]: pass it as an argument when running the script
[00:34:54] [@john0isaac]: owner/reponame
[00:35:20] [@john0isaac]: after you ask the question it will do the visualization
[00:39:02] [@john0isaac]: yes, i only fixed the typing and made it work. during the session
[00:39:15] [@john0isaac]: the types changed you are right
[00:40:17] [@john0isaac]: maybe it's key vs value check
[00:40:22] [@john0isaac]: try running it and let's see
[00:42:35] [@john0isaac]: I was wondering why it was's showing me anything too
[00:46:22] [@john0isaac]: also I tried gpt-5 multiple times and it failed
[00:46:29] [@john0isaac]: the original example had gpt-5
[00:48:47] [@john0isaac]: they have migrated everything to async only
[00:48:59] [@john0isaac]: tell it to follow the working example
[00:55:38] [@HatmanStack]: When in doubt wildcard it out
[00:55:46] [@john0isaac]: it's says empty list means none so yes you are correct
[01:01:32] [@yashhgami]: Hi, hope you're well! Been a while!
[01:02:15] [@john0isaac]: it ignored the tools 
[01:03:37] [@john0isaac]: there is an MCP Field I think
[01:04:51] [@john0isaac]: I think you add tools up there to allow them and add MCP config down there to give it the MCP server source?
[01:06:04] [@john0isaac]: just one thing tools=["*"] then let's see if it works
[01:06:53] [@john0isaac]: I mean down there in the mcp_servers yes
[01:07:02] [@john0isaac]: me too
[01:08:25] [@john0isaac]: did you provide a repo anywhere?
[01:10:46] [@john0isaac]: did you provide github mcp config?
[01:10:56] [@john0isaac]: is it using it?
[01:11:04] [@john0isaac]: lol
[01:14:40] [@takescake]: oh no.
[01:15:51] [@john0isaac]: hidden message
[01:15:56] [@takescake]: Your issue is resolved ""
[01:18:08] [@PamelaFox]: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azur...
[01:20:38] [@john0isaac]: thanks! I learn a lot too.
